  scheduler {
    # The LightArrayRevolverScheduler is used as the default scheduler in the
    # system. It does not execute the scheduled tasks on exact time, but on every
    # tick, it will run everything that is (over)due. You can increase or decrease
    # the accuracy of the execution timing by specifying smaller or larger tick
    # duration. If you are scheduling a lot of tasks you should consider increasing
    # the ticks per wheel.
    # Note that it might take up to 1 tick to stop the Timer, so setting the
    # tick-duration to a high value will make shutting down the actor system
    # take longer.
    tick-duration = 10ms

    # The timer uses a circular wheel of buckets to store the timer tasks.
    # This should be set such that the majority of scheduled timeouts (for high
    # scheduling frequency) will be shorter than one rotation of the wheel
    # (ticks-per-wheel * ticks-duration)
    # THIS MUST BE A POWER OF TWO!
    ticks-per-wheel = 512

    # This setting selects the timer implementation which shall be loaded at
    # system start-up.
    # The class given here must implement the akka.actor.Scheduler interface
    # and offer a public constructor which takes three arguments:
    #  1) com.typesafe.config.Config
    #  2) akka.event.LoggingAdapter
    #  3) java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory
    implementation = akka.actor.LightArrayRevolverScheduler

    # When shutting down the scheduler, there will typically be a thread which
    # needs to be stopped, and this timeout determines how long to wait for
    # that to happen. In case of timeout the shutdown of the actor system will
    # proceed without running possibly still enqueued tasks.
